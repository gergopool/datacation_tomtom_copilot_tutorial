# Quiz: Why step-by-step?

**While vibe-coding with 2026's state-of-the-art models works very well, we still develop in a step-by-step manner. Why?**

**A)** Because AI makes more bugs than human engineers
**B)** Because AI is not responsible for the code — humans are
**C)** Because AI tends to overcomplicate solutions
**D)** Because step-by-step prompts produce fewer hallucinations

Not quite. AI-generated code quality is often comparable to human code. The issue isn't about bug count — it's about who owns the result.

<details><summary>B</summary>

Correct! You sign off on the code. You maintain it. You debug it at 2 AM. Working step-by-step keeps you in control and ensures you understand every change going into your codebase. The AI is a powerful tool, but the responsibility is yours.

<details><summary>C</summary>

Not really. AI can produce clean, simple solutions — it depends on your prompt and constraints. Overcomplication isn't inherent to AI.

</details>

<details><summary>D</summary>

While step-by-step prompting can be helpful, that's not really the reason we do it. It's about human ownership and understanding, not prompt engineering tricks.
