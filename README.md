# Snake Game

A hands-on guide to **agentic coding with GitHub Copilot**, built around a minimal snake game (HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript). Use arrow keys or WASD to control the snake.

## How to run

In the terminal, start a simple HTTP server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (Codespaces will auto-forward the port for you).

## Exercise

This game is the starting point for an agentic coding exercise.
